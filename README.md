angular-pdf.js
==============

a directive for angular js to render pdfs with Mozilla's pdf.js

## Mac

to get up and running fire up a terminal at this folder location and:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

## Windows

get busy with IIS and virtual dirs etc..etc..

# Issues:

Really needs some UI love. This should be enough codez to get you up and running with pdf.js. Enjoy
